            <div>

                <p>The journey began in 2008 with 1 small store . . .</p>

                <p>The Eggfree Cake Box opened its first store in the heart of East London in 2008.
                Its mission was to provide the UK market with a new concept; delicious fresh cream
                Celebration Cakes made without using eggs and an ‘on demand’ service.
                By eliminating the egg, without compromising on taste and texture,
                ECB cakes were an instant success; and a favourite amongst many who have 
                certain religious, dietary and/or lifestyle choices.</p>
