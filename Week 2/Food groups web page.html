            These fats play a major role in controlling inflammation, blood-coagulation, and brain development. It also serves as a storage unit for storing the bodyâ€™s 
            extra calories in fat cells or adipose tissue that helps to insulate the body. They tend to be an important source of energy. 
            Fats also help the body to absorb and transport the vitamins A, D, E, and K through the bloodstream. </p>

            <p> For a human body to function correctly, it needs carbohydrates, protein, fat, water, minerals and vitamins. 
            Similar to other forms of carbohydrates, such as starch, sugar contains 4 kilocalories per gram. Comparatively, 1 gram of protein has 4 kilocalories, 
            1 gram of fat has 9 kilocalories and 1 gram of alcohol has 7 kilocalories. Sugar exists in nature, such as plant sugar, which is a product of photosynthesis. 
            Sucrose, the most common type of sugar, is extracted from beet or cane by sugar manufacturers. </p>
